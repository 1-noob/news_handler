# news_handler v3.0.1


News Handler is a lightweight system for fetching articles from news websites, categorizing them, and storing them in a database for structured access and long-term use. Its purpose is to help me in my exam preperations by maintaining a record of news that is important for subjective exams.

The project is designed to automate personal news collection by centralizing articles, organizing them using rule-based categorization, and persisting them reliably. It serves as the foundation for a future API-driven service to manage news-related tasks remotely.

This system can easily be modified to suit individual needs like tracking buisness related news, or stock market news, or a blog. (Only requirement is that they should support [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or else you have to use RSS genertor websites).
